## 🚀 Overview

**URLStash** is an AI-powered knowledge management tool that instantly transforms raw URLs into a centralized, structured digital library. 

It solves the problem of "tab hoarding" and messy web research by leveraging advanced scraping to strip away ads and clutter, while integrated AI automatically extracts and summarizes key insights for rapid consumption.
